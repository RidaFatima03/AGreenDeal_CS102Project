# AGreenDeal_CS102Project
"A Green Deal" is a mobile application that offers an intuitive platform connecting landowners and professionals with a visually engaging, user-friendly interface. Prioritizing simplicity, it facilitates easy navigation, showcases land resources, and streamlines the dealing process, promoting sustainability and economic advantage.

The application was developed using Figma for its GUI (Graphical User Interface) and Android Studio for composing GUI with backend development. To store data that contains listings and user information, FireStore was used, one of the most common database for mobile development. 

Our application basically has two target audiences; 
1. The first is people who own land but cannot use it efficiently and lose the productivity of their land day by day. These landowners are divided into two. Those who want to rent their land only with the money method and who are aware that their field will be empty if they do not have a tenant, so they accept non-monetary rent payment methods.
2. The second main target audience is individuals who want to rent land and use it for their purposes.
